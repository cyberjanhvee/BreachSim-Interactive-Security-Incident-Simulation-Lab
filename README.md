#BreachSim – Security Incident Simulation Lab

BreachSim is an interactive cybersecurity simulation dashboard designed to model common attack scenarios in a controlled, educational environment.
It simulates phishing campaigns, malware execution in a sandbox, and brute-force attacks while generating real-time logs and exportable JSON incident reports.
